## General Info

This project is a **phishing detection system** that uses machine learning models trained on URL features to classify whether a given URL is legitimate or phishing. It includes:

- A **Python-based feature extraction module** to process URLs.
- A **pre-trained ML model** for prediction.
- A **Tkinter-based GUI** for user-friendly interaction.

The application helps users identify potentially malicious URLs instantly and demonstrates practical ML integration in cybersecurity.

The GUI takes user input, extracts features from the URL, feeds them into the ML model, and displays whether it is **Legitimate** or **Phishing**.

## Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- **Joblib** (Model Serialization)
- **Regex (`re`)** (Feature extraction)

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or newer**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Joblib**

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

## Installation & Usage

Clone the repository and run the application as follows:

git clone https://github.com/Achuzzxd/Cyber_Security_and_Ethical_Hacking.git
cd Cyber_Security_and_Ethical_Hacking/Phishing\ URL\ detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/gui.py



### Usage

- Enter the URL you want to check in the input field.
- Click "**üß† Analyze URL**" or press Enter.
- The result will display whether the URL is **Legitimate** (green) or **Phishing** (red).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Model not found:**  
  Ensure that `phishing_detector_model.pkl` exists in the specified `models/` directory.
- **Module not found error:**  
  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install missing dependencies.
- **GUI does not open:**  
  Confirm that Tkinter is installed and you are using Python 3.

## Collaboration

**Contributions are welcome!** You can:

- Fork the repository and submit pull requests for enhancements.
- Report issues with detailed reproduction steps.
- Suggest additional features or improvements.

## Known Issues & Bug Fixes

- Currently supports **single URL input** at a time.
- **No backend database** for storing prediction logs.
- **Model performance** depends on training data; real-time URL threat analysis is not implemented yet.

---

## FAQs

**What does this app do?**  
It checks if a given URL is phishing or legitimate using a trained ML model.

**How does it detect phishing?**  
It extracts numerical features from the URL and uses a supervised machine learning model to classify it.

**Can I use it on any platform?**  
Yes. It works on any OS with Python 3 and Tkinter installed.

**How can I train my own model?**  
You can modify the `feature_extraction.py` and use scikit-learn to train with your own dataset.

**Is it 100% accurate?**  
No ML model is perfect. It predicts based on patterns in training data; real-time analysis and threat feeds are required for production use.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority

- **Integrate real-time threat intelligence feeds** to check URLs against blacklists.
- **Enhance feature engineering** with WHOIS data, SSL certificate checks, and URL shortening detection.
- **Deploy as a web application** for easy user access.

### Medium Priority

- **Train with larger, up-to-date datasets** for better accuracy.
- **Add batch URL scanning** to check multiple URLs at once.
- **Implement result logging** to track past predictions.

### Low Priority

- **Improve GUI aesthetics** with modern frameworks like PyQt or web-based UI.
- **Add notification alerts** for phishing detection.
- **Create installer executables** for Windows and Mac.
